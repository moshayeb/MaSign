# Frontend Conventions

Decided 2026-09-14, before any UI code exists, so that MAS-17/MAS-18 and all
later UI work follow the same rules.

## Stack

- **React + Vite**, in `frontend/`, built to static files and served by the
  FastAPI app (so `docker compose up --build` still starts everything).
- **sonner** for toast notifications. Chosen over react-hot-toast for
  `toast.promise()` (loading → success/error in one call) and stacking.

## Toast rules (apply to every user action, now and in the future)

1. Every async user action (upload, ask a question, load list, delete) reports
   its outcome through a toast. Use `toast.promise()` so the loading state,
   success and error are wired together and can't drift apart.
2. **Error toasts show the API's actual `detail` message** from the error
   response body — never a generic "Something went wrong". This is why every
   API error path returns `{"detail": "<human-readable reason>"}` (400, 404,
   413, 415, 422, 503). If a response has no `detail`, fall back to the HTTP
   status text. Validation errors (422) follow the same contract: `detail` is
   one readable line such as `question: String should have at least 1
   character`; the structured per-field list is available under `errors` for
   inline form hints.
3. Success toasts only where the outcome isn't already obvious on screen.
   "contract.pdf uploaded — 12 chunks" is useful; "Answer ready" next to a
   rendered answer is noise.
4. One `<Toaster />` at the app root; call `toast` from wherever the API call
   is made (a small `api.ts` wrapper that unwraps `detail` keeps this uniform).

Backend implication: keep error `detail` strings user-readable, since they
are displayed verbatim.
